      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>I'm a young and aspiring artist and developer. I have some big plans for future comic and game projects, so stay tuned! I've been drawing for over 6 years, along with many other hobbies. Calligraphy has been a more recent fascination of mine, developed after taking multiple classes to master it. Web development is just plain fun! I enjoy the opportunity I have to be able to help other people with their vision. My two favorite bands are Blink-182 and AJR, though I enjoy some Bowling for Soup and Offspring sprinkled in. I'm totally willing to fine tune the most high-quality and ideal result for you! Just reach out and we can create anything! </p>
