    <h1>Welcome and Hello!</h1>

      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>I'm a young and aspiring artist and developer. I have some big plans for future comic and game projects, so stay tuned! I've been drawing for over 6 years, along with many other hobbies. Calligraphy has been a more recent fascination of mine, developed after taking multiple classes to master it. Web development is just plain fun! I enjoy the opportunity I have to help other people with their vision. My two favorite bands are Blink-182 and AJR, though I enjoy some Bowling for Soup and Offspring sprinkled in. I'm willing to fine-tune the highest-quality and ideal result for you! Just reach out and we can create anything! </p>
    <h2>
      About my Services
    </h2>
    <p>I have prices and presets made for each service if you'd like to keep it simple. I also offer customization of any product and am willing to try something new! My goal is to ensure you have the best experience and get the best result. With art or calligraphy services, I price by the value of materials, so it may vary depending on what size or material you would like. With web design services, I price by the amount of content being made.   </p>
